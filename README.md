#Going Dutch App

Had to install
npm install ng2-haversine --save; calculates distance between 2 points
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-haversine
And used with ionic 2 native Geolocation

Good way of emitting events across; using BehaviorSubject, in group service, to send array to slide out menu: look in group.ts, app.Component and group.service
